The project focuses on building a resilient HTTP server in C that supports the GET and PUT methods while adhering to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. The server is designed to handle client connections sequentially, ensuring stability and robustness even when faced with invalid or malicious inputs. It performs essential operations such as listening for incoming connections, parsing requests, processing file operations, and generating appropriate responses based on the validity and outcome of each request.

Key functionalities include creating a listening socket to accept connections, reading client requests, validating the HTTP method, URI, and version, and performing file operations as specified in the requests. For a GET request, the server retrieves and returns the contents of the requested file. For a PUT request, it either creates or updates the specified file with the provided content. In cases of invalid requests, unsupported methods, or non-existent files, the server generates error responses with the correct status codes, such as 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found.

The implementation emphasizes modularity and efficiency, requiring careful design of request parsing and response handling. Students are encouraged to design their server with clear, modular components and validate their implementation iteratively. The project also enforces best practices in memory management and resource utilization, ensuring that the server operates efficiently without leaks or crashes.

This project provides a hands-on opportunity to deepen understanding of client-server architectures, string parsing, file I/O, and robust system design, while also preparing the server to handle real-world challenges such as malformed inputs and concurrent connections. It emphasizes creating a functional, resilient system that adheres to defined standards and performs reliably under test scenarios.
